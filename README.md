# TicTacToe

Simple game of Tic Tac Toe played in the console with a ruby gem.

- I did not create this, followed along with https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/creating-a-tic-tac-toe-game-with-ruby/

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tic_tac_toe'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tic_tac_toe

## Usage

Play a round of Tic Tac Toe

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
